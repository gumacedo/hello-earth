# hello-earth

Hi Homo sapiens,

Im Bob the builder from three galaxies fair away. I'd like to visit earth very soon but you have to improve your technologies before. As I can see you guys are pretty young using TV and paying your bills by card.
Although I want to come this year I'll wait for next year. Hopefully the technology and differents aways has changed.

Thank you,
Bob the builder.
